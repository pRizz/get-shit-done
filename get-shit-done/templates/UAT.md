## File Template

```markdown

## Current Test

## Tests

### 1. [Test Name]

<section-rules>

**Frontmatter:**

- `status`: OVERWRITE - "testing", "partial", or "complete"
- `phase`: IMMUTABLE - set on creation
- `source`: IMMUTABLE - SUMMARY files being tested
- `started`: IMMUTABLE - set on creation
- `updated`: OVERWRITE - update on every change

**Current Test:**

- OVERWRITE entirely on each test transition
- Shows which test is active and what's awaited
- On completion: "[testing complete]"

**Tests:**

- Each test: OVERWRITE result field when user responds
- `result` values: [pending], pass, issue, skipped, blocked
- If agent-verified pass: add `verified_by: agent` and `evidence` with exact commands, artifact paths, or concise observations
- If issue: add `reported` (verbatim) and `severity` (inferred)
- If skipped: add `reason` if provided
- If blocked: add `blocked_by` (tag) and `reason` (if provided)

**Summary:**

- OVERWRITE counts after each response
- Tracks: total, passed, issues, pending, skipped

**Gaps:**

- APPEND only when issue found (YAML format)
- After diagnosis: fill `root_cause`, `artifacts`, `missing`, `debug_session`
- This section feeds directly into /gsd-plan-phase --gaps

</section-rules>

<diagnosis-lifecycle>

**After testing complete (status: complete), if gaps exist:**

1. User runs diagnosis (from verify-work offer or manually)
1. diagnose-issues workflow spawns parallel debug agents
1. Each agent investigates one gap, returns root cause
1. UAT.md Gaps section updated with diagnosis:
   - Each gap gets `root_cause`, `artifacts`, `missing`, `debug_session` filled
1. status → "diagnosed"
1. Ready for /gsd-plan-phase --gaps with root causes

**After diagnosis:**

```yaml
## Gaps

- truth: "Comment appears immediately after submission"
  status: failed
  reason: "User reported: works but doesn't show until I refresh the page"
  severity: major
  test: 2
  root_cause: "useEffect in CommentList.tsx missing commentCount dependency"
  artifacts:
    - path: "src/components/CommentList.tsx"
      issue: "useEffect missing dependency"
  missing:
    - "Add commentCount to useEffect dependency array"
  debug_session: ".planning/debug/comment-not-refreshing.md"
```

</diagnosis-lifecycle>

<lifecycle>

**Creation:** When /gsd-verify-work starts new session

- Extract tests from SUMMARY.md files
- Set status to "testing"
- Current Test points to test 1
- All tests have result: [pending]

**During testing:**

- Before presenting a manual checkpoint, complete simple objective checkpoints when they are verifiable from repo artifacts or non-destructive commands
- Present test from Current Test section when agent verification is not sufficient
- User responds with pass confirmation or issue description
- Update test result (pass/issue/skipped)
- If agent-verified pass: add `verified_by: agent` and `evidence`
- Update Summary counts
- If issue: append to Gaps section (YAML format), infer severity
- Move Current Test to next pending test

**On completion:**

- status → "complete"
- Current Test → "[testing complete]"
- Commit file
- Present summary with next steps

**Partial completion:**

- status → "partial" (if pending, blocked, or unresolved skipped tests remain)
- Current Test → "[testing paused — {N} items outstanding]"
- Commit file
- Present summary with outstanding items highlighted

**Resuming partial session:**

- `/gsd-verify-work {phase}` picks up from first pending/blocked test
- When all items resolved, status advances to "complete"

**Resume after /clear:**

1. Read frontmatter → know phase and status
1. Read Current Test → know where we are
1. Find first [pending] result → continue from there
1. Summary shows progress so far

</lifecycle>

<severity-guide>

Severity is INFERRED from user's natural language, never asked.

| User describes                                         | Infer    |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Crash, error, exception, fails completely, unusable    | blocker  |
| Doesn't work, nothing happens, wrong behavior, missing | major    |
| Works but..., slow, weird, minor, small issue          | minor    |
| Color, font, spacing, alignment, visual, looks off     | cosmetic |

Default: **major** (safe default, user can clarify if wrong)
